# Digital Business Card

Once upon a time, I learned React but it was kind of hazy. So I'm on a journey to relearning it! I built a digital business card as a solo project from the Scrimba course React JS with Bob Ziroll.

<b>Technologies used:</b>

- React, of course
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid and Modules
